  Provides a daemon that listens for builds on Buildkite and spawns ephemeral virtual machines running Buildkite Agent on a VMWare vSphere cluster. After the build has finished the instance is destroyed. This allows for a repeatable environment for testing.
  <br>
  Requires a vSphere Datastore with the base virtual machine image in a .vmx format. Currently MacStadium provides these for you as part of your private cluster, contact us for the location to use.
